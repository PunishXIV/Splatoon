## Key features
- Put infinite amount of waymarks in the world with different shapes, colors, hit text, etc.
- Create various trggers and conditions to display them in specific situations.
- Quickly find objects around you using `/sf` command.
- Create, import and share scripts - extensions of Splatoon, capable of doing pretty much any stuff that any Dalamud plugin can do, but in a much faster to create way and with a lot of helper objects provided. Ideal for creating so-called "microplugins" without hassle of creating full plugin just to do some small thing.
- Use Web API to integrate Splatoon with other programs and ECommons Splatoon API to integrate it with other plugins.

## Important information
- Splatoon is designed to operate primarily as an accessibility tool to compensate for people's imperfections.
- By default, Splatoon comes with no presets or scripts preinstalled. It's on you to find and import ones that you want to use or create your own.
- Imported presets will not update automatically. Should new version become available, you will have to update it yourself.
- Imported (from official repo) scripts, however, will update automatically.
- Splatoon only operates on a client side. Other players can not see and can not interact with your presets and scripts. Server can not check whether you are using Splatoon or not.
- Splatoon only uses data you supply. Additionally, Splatoon uses only data that is available to you normally, without going beyond standard game client operations.
- It is advised against streaming or screen sharing while using Splatoon.
- Presets and scripts that can be used to deteriorate other player experience are not accepted.

## Information for Chinese players
Ottercorp's version currently blocks Splatoon and many other plugins from being loaded.

Just use Atmo's version of Xivlauncher instead: https://github.com/AtmoOmen/FFXIVQuickLauncher
